# Overview

In my pursuit of continuous learning as a software engineer, I have developed a software project with the aim of enhancing my skills and knowledge. The software I've created serves as a practical application of what I've learned and showcases my ability to build a functional system.

## Description

I developed an event website by utilizing a tech stack that includes JavaScript, and React.

## Purpose

The primary purpose behind creating this software is to establish a user-centric and efficient events website. Through this platform, users can browse an extensive catalog of events, access detailed information about each event, and create or edit events.
